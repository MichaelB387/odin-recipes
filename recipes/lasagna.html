    <h2>Steps to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the Meat Sauce:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of Italian sausage over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
                <li>Add 1 chopped large onion and cook until tender. Stir in 4 minced garlic cloves and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add 2 cans of crushed tomatoes (28 ounces each), 2 cans of tomato paste (6 ounces each), 1 can of tomato sauce (15 ounces), and 1/2 cup of water. Stir well.</li>
                <li>Season with 2 tablespoons of sugar, 1/4 cup of chopped fresh basil (or 1 tablespoon dried basil), 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley (or 1 tablespoon dried parsley), 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper. Simmer on low heat for 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the Cheese Filling:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium bowl, mix 16 ounces of ricotta cheese, 1 large egg, 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley (or 1 tablespoon dried parsley), 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper until well combined.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cook the Lasagna Noodles:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add 12 lasagna noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes until al dente. Drain and rinse with cold water. Lay the noodles flat on a baking sheet or foil to prevent sticking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Preheat the Oven:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Assemble the First Layer:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place 3 to 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Add the Cheese Mixture:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Sprinkle 1/3 of the shredded mozzarella cheese (about 1 pound total) on top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Second Layer of Sauce and Noodles:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spoon 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese. Place another 3 to 4 lasagna noodles on top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Repeat Layers:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread the remaining ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles. Add another 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese. Spoon 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce over the mozzarella, sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese, and place the final layer of noodles on top.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Top with Sauce and Cheese:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread the remaining meat sauce over the top layer of noodles. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Bake:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover with aluminum foil (to prevent sticking, you can spray the foil with cooking spray). Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let the lasagna cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
